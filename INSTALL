First make sure that you've also pulled the modules:
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

To compile the project use the shipped 'configure' script:
$ mkdir build
$ ../configure <Your options here>
$ make -jX
$ sudo make install

That's pretty much it. Having problems? Read the README for contct details!
