First make sure that you've also pulled the modules:
$ git submodule update --init

To prepare the project use CMake. Note that you can configure some aspects
when calling cmake itself.
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake .. # -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

And now, compile everything (Replace the 'X' with your CPU core count), run the
tests and if everything is fine, install it!
$ make -jX
$ make test
$ make install

That's pretty much it. Having problems? Read the README for contact details!
